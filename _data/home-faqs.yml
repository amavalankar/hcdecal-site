  label: What are your application criteria?
  answer: |
    Unfortuantely, we don't have the capacity to enroll every applicant. That being said, we look for individuals passionate about design—regardless of skillsets.
    
    We focus mainly on your responses in the application form, and provide slight priority to those who've previously applied or are closer to graduating.
