## About the Course
This class is an 11-week introduction to design theory and design practice, with a focus on human-centered design. The course will have an emphasis on digital design but concepts of physical design will also be covered. The course meets weekly for two hours for discussions, guest speakers, activities developing fundamental design skills, and project “crit” sessions. This class will provide its students with a fun and comprehensive look into all facets of design, experience working on design projects, and potential portfolio pieces.

No previous design experience is required, however, it is imperative that students have an open mind, a willingness to get out of their comfort zone, and a sense of humor.

The class meets in Jacobs 310 every Monday from 7pm to 9pm.

## Evaluation and Grading
This class can only be taken P/NP. Students will be evaluated based on attendance, participation in discussions, activities, and crit sessions, as well as weekly homework assignments and completion of projects.

Weekly homework assignments will be key to understanding and putting into practice the design concepts taught in class. Two design projects must be completed by the end of the semester, with each project reflecting an increasing level of conceptual refinement.

* 30% Homework Assignments
* 30% Group Project (midterm)
* 40% Individual Project (final)

> You're allowed a **MAXIMUM OF ONE UNEXCUSED ABSENCE**, no questions asked and no makeup assignment needed.

Please fill out the excused attendance form in advance if you know you will be absent from class. If you exceed one unexcused absence/missed makeup assignment, **you may fail the course**. Please see below for more information.
